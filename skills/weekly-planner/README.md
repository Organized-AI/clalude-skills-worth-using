# 📅 Weekly Planner Skill

> A comprehensive weekly planning system that uses energy-based scheduling, 2-3 weekly anchors, and continuous improvement through strategic weekly reviews.

## 🎯 Overview

The Weekly Planner skill manages a sustainable productivity framework designed to scale output without burnout. It integrates with Claude's memory system to track progress, learn your patterns, and continuously improve your planning accuracy.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Energy-Based Scheduling**: Categorizes tasks as Drain/Neutral/Energize and schedules them optimally
- **Weekly Anchors**: Focus on 2-3 major projects per week (P0/P1 priorities)
- **Sacred Morning Practice**: Protects morning time until 1pm for spiritual/foundational work
- **Evening Learning Time**: Leverages 7pm-9pm for skill development and strategic planning
- **Strategic Growth System**: Friday evening reviews for continuous improvement
- **Memory Integration**: Tracks progress, patterns, and insights across weeks

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Activation Phrases

The skill activates when you:
- "Plan my week"
- "Start new weekly plan"
- "I completed [task]"
- "Weekly review"
- "What's on my schedule?"
- "Show my current week"

### First Time Setup

1. **Sunday/Monday Planning**:
   ```
   "I want to plan my week"
   ```
   
   Claude will ask you:
   - Your 2-3 anchor projects
   - The ONE outcome that would make this week a win
   - Key meetings/deadlines
   - Learning focus
   - Any carry-over items

2. **Daily Progress Updates**:
   ```
   "I completed the API integration. Took 3 hours, felt more draining than expected."
   ```

3. **Friday Review**:
   ```
   "Let's do the weekly review"
   ```

## 📚 Core Concepts

### Energy Types

- **🔴 Drain**: Takes significant mental/emotional energy
  - Complex technical work, difficult decisions, client negotiations
  - Schedule: Monday/Tuesday when energy is highest

- **🟡 Neutral**: Neither drains nor energizes
  - Documentation, routine tasks, updates
  - Schedule: Wednesday/Thursday for steady progress

- **🟢 Energize**: Boosts energy
  - Creative work, learning new skills, strategic thinking
  - Schedule: Friday as rewards + strategic review

### Weekly Structure

```
Morning (Until 1pm)
┌────────────────────┐
│  Sacred Practice   │  Non-negotiable foundation
│                    │  Spiritual work, meditation, 
│                    │  exercise, reading
└────────────────────┘

Afternoon (1pm-6pm)
┌────────────────────┐
│   Deep Work Block  │  4-5 hour focused sessions
│                    │  Single anchor project
│                    │  No context switching
└────────────────────┘

Evening (7pm-9pm)
┌────────────────────┐
│ Learning Time     │  Skill development
│                    │  Strategic planning
│                    │  1-2 hours progressive
└────────────────────┘
```

### Priority Levels

- **P0**: Must complete (client deliverables, critical deadlines)
- **P1**: Should complete (important progress on key initiatives)
- **P2**: Nice to complete (strategic but not urgent)

## 📊 Workflow Examples

### Example 1: Starting New Week

**You:**
```
Let's plan this week
```

**Claude:**
```
Let's plan your week! Quick questions:

1. What are your 2-3 ANCHOR projects this week?
2. What's the ONE outcome that would make this week a win?
3. Any key meetings, calls, or deadlines?
4. Learning focus this week?
5. Anything from last week that needs to carry over?
```

**You provide answers, then Claude generates your complete weekly plan with:**
- Anchor definitions
- Energy-mapped tasks
- Daily schedule blocks
- Learning time allocation
- Strategic connections

### Example 2: Daily Progress

**You:**
```
Completed the database migration. Took 4 hours, was more neutral than I expected.
```

**Claude:**
```
✅ Progress saved!

Today's completion: Database Migration
Time: 4hrs (estimated 3hrs)
Energy: Neutral (predicted Drain)

Note: This task felt different than expected - good to know for future migrations!

Tomorrow: API endpoint implementation
```

### Example 3: Friday Review

**You:**
```
Weekly review time
```

**Claude retrieves your week's data and presents:**
- Anchor completion status
- What worked well
- What to improve
- Key insights about your patterns
- Suggested experiments for next week
- Reflection prompts

## 🛠️ Configuration

### Customization Options

You can adjust these in your planning conversations:

- **Deep Work Hours**: Default 1pm-6pm (customize to your schedule)
- **Learning Time**: Default 7pm-9pm, start 1hr and build up
- **Anchor Count**: 2-3 recommended, can adjust based on capacity
- **Energy Predictions**: Learn and refine through weekly tracking

### Memory Integration

The skill automatically stores:
- Weekly anchors and tasks
- Time estimates vs actuals
- Energy predictions vs reality
- Completion status
- Insights and patterns
- Experiment results

## 🎯 Success Metrics

Track these to know if the system is working:

1. **Completion Rate**: 100% of P0 anchors, 80%+ of P1 anchors
2. **Time Accuracy**: Within ±20% of estimates consistently
3. **Energy Accuracy**: 80%+ correct predictions
4. **Learning Investment**: 5-10hrs evening time weekly
5. **Morning Practice**: 7+/10 average quality score
6. **Burnout Check**: Feel energized Monday mornings

## 📝 Reference Materials

The skill includes comprehensive reference documents:

- **weekly-template.md**: Complete planning template structure
- **strategic-growth-system.md**: Friday review framework
- **planning-philosophy.md**: Core principles and philosophy

These are automatically loaded when needed during planning conversations.

## 👥 Who This Is For

- **Developers/Creators**: Balance deep technical work with learning
- **Spiritual Practitioners**: Honor morning practice while scaling output
- **Knowledge Workers**: Maximize impact per hour worked
- **Continuous Learners**: Leverage evening time for skill development
- **Anti-Burnout**: Sustainable high performance without exhaustion

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls

1. **Over-scheduling**: Be realistic - 20hrs deep work is FULL
2. **Ignoring Energy**: Monday = Drain, Friday = Energize
3. **Evening Obligation**: Start with 1hr, build gradually
4. **No Tracking**: Learn from actual vs estimated patterns
5. **Abandoning Morning**: Never compromise the foundation
6. **Perfectionism**: Plan once, execute well, review Friday

## 🚀 The Compounding Effect

- **Week 1**: Establish the system
- **Week 4**: Start seeing patterns
- **Week 12**: 80%+ estimation accuracy
- **Week 26**: System runs automatically
- **Week 52**: 1000+ focused hours + 260-520hrs learning

**This is how you scale without burning out.**
